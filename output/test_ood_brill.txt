his PRP$

His PRP$

always RB

often RB
a DT
little JJ
too RB
serious JJ

his PRP$

sense NN

peace NN
about IN

a DT
lightness NN
that IN

A DT
few JJ
times NNS

when WRB
Tyler NN

she PRP
took VBD
him PRP

He PRP

how WRB

When WRB
she PRP
died VBD

grief NN

Tyler NN

But CC
like IN
most JJS
adults NNS

when WRB
he PRP
grew VBD
older JJR
he PRP
could MD
only RB
recall NN
the DT
intensity NN
of IN
that WDT

childhood NN
in IN
an DT

He PRP
made VBD
the DT
common JJ
error NN
of IN
identifying VBG
maturity NN
with IN

, ,
and CC
assumed VBD
that IN

for IN
her PRP
as IN
a DT
young NN
child NN
must MD
have VB
been VBN
lacking VBG

For IN
many JJ
years NNS
after IN
her PRP
death NN
, ,
however RB
, ,
Tyler NN
was VBD
tortured VBN
by IN
the DT
memory NN
of IN
a DT
certain JJ
visit NN
from IN

He PRP
was VBD
five CD

they PRP
were VBD
playing VBG
some DT

at IN

As IN

She NN
asked VBN
him PRP

he PRP
refused VBD

giggling VBG

When WRB
she PRP
finally RB
frowned VBD
at IN
him PRP

threatened VBD
to TO
stop VB
playing VBG
if IN
he PRP
did VBD
n’t RB
stop VB
he PRP
told VBD
her PRP
to TO
go VB

Hell NNP

In IN
Tyler NN

mind NN
he PRP
could MD
see VB
her PRP

grow VB

then RB
, ,
for IN
the DT
only JJ
time NN
he PRP
could MD
remember VB

she PRP
began VBD
to TO
cry NN

He PRP
also RB
remembered VBD
his PRP$
own JJ
utter JJ
confusion NN
. .

His PRP$
parents NNS
did VBD
not RB
have VBP
much RB
use VB
for IN
religion NN
and CC
so RB
for IN
him PRP
Hell NNP
was VBD
a DT
word NN
without IN
much RB
mystery NN
or CC
power NN

At IN
that IN
time NN
he PRP
knew NN
only RB
vaguely RB
that IN
Hell NNP
was VBD
a DT
place NN
you PRP
did VBD
not RB
want VBP

, ,
like IN
the DT
dark JJ
basement NN
or CC
the DT
even RB
darker JJR
attic NN
. .

He PRP
remembered VBD
feeling VBG
resentful NN
that IN
she PRP
was VBD
crying VBG
and CC
he PRP
did VBD
not RB
even RB
understand VB
why WRB
. .

Tyler NN
felt NN
the DT
guilt NN
of IN
this DT
memory NN
even RB
in IN
his PRP$
teenage NN
years NNS
. .

For IN
him PRP
it PRP
summed VBD
up RP
all DT
his PRP$
insecurities NNS
and CC
fears NNS
about IN
his PRP$
own JJ
cruelty NN
, ,
ignorance NN
, ,
and CC
the DT
possibility NN
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
, ,
in IN
reality NN
, ,
not RB
a DT
good JJ
person NN
. .

The DT
fact NN
that IN
he PRP
had VBD
caused VBD
someone NN
who WP
loved VBD
him PRP
such JJ
pain NN
with IN
so RB
little JJ
effort NN
and CC
understanding VBG
troubled VBD
him PRP
deeply RB
. .

One CD
day NN
Tyler NN
looked VBD
through IN
an DT
old JJ
family NN
photo NN
album NN
, ,
and CC
in IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
picture NN
of IN
the DT
kitchen NN
in IN
the DT
house NN
they PRP
used VBD
to TO
live VB
in IN

He PRP
was VBD
surprised VBN
to TO
discover VB
that IN
the DT
small JJ
kitchen NN
contained VBD
a DT
central JJ
island NN
, ,
and CC
had VBD
no DT
space NN
for IN
the DT

in IN
his PRP$

at IN
all DT

With IN
the DT
discovery NN
of IN
that IN
single JJ
error NN
in IN
his PRP$
memory NN
came VBD
a DT
cascade NN
of IN
other JJ
revelations NNS

Now NN
he PRP
remembered VBD
that IN
they PRP
always RB
ate NN
in IN
the DT
dining NN
room NN
, ,
and CC
when WRB
they PRP
did VBD
play VB

, ,
it PRP
was VBD
always RB
on IN
the DT
coffee NN
table JJ
in IN
the DT
living VBG
room NN
. .

The DT
memory NN
that IN
had VBD
caused VBD
him PRP
such JJ
pain NN
over IN
the DT
years NNS
could MD
not RB
possibly RB
have VB
occurred VBD
. .

Somehow NN
, ,
he PRP
must MD
have VB
manufactured VBD
the DT
whole JJ
scene NN
in IN
his PRP$
imagination NN
. .

It PRP
was VBD
not RB
very RB
hard JJ
to TO
explain NN
what WP
really RB
happened VBD
, ,
he PRP
thought VBD
. .

The DT
death NN
of IN
his PRP$
grandmother NN
had VBD
probably RB
caused VBD
in IN
him PRP
feelings NNS
of IN
abandonment NN
and CC
guilt NN
. .

In IN
his PRP$
confusion NN
he PRP$
had VBD
taken VBN
elements NNS
from IN
storybooks NNS
and CC
imagined VBD
out RP
of IN
nothing NN
this DT
memory NN
to IN
punish NN
himself NN
. .

This DT
was VBD
the DT
sort NN
of IN
fantasy NN
that WDT
could MD
have VB
occurred VBD
to IN
any DT
young NN
child NN
who WP
lost VBD
an DT
important JJ
relative NN

With IN
that IN
realization NN
, ,
the DT
image NN
of IN
his PRP$
grandmother NN
crying VBG
faded VBD
in IN
his PRP$
memory NN
and CC
became VBD
less RBR
and CC
less RBR
believable JJ
. .

Tyler NN
thought VBD
he PRP
was VBD
very RB
lucky JJ
to TO
have VB
discovered VBN
the DT
single JJ
error NN
in IN
his PRP$
false JJ
memory NN
, ,
which WDT
enabled VBD
him PRP
to TO
reason NN
his PRP$
way NN
into IN
distinguishing VBG
between IN
reality NN

fantasy NN
. .

He PRP
felt NN
that IN
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
coming-of-age NN
moment NN
. .

Nonetheless NNS
, ,
he PRP
admitted VBD
to TO
himself NN
that IN
he PRP
was VBD
a DT
little JJ
sad NN
also RB
at IN
the DT
discovery NN

For IN
however RB
imaginary NN
that IN
memory NN
was VBD
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
also RB
a DT
part NN
of IN
his PRP$

for IN
his PRP$

When WRB
that IN
memory NN
lost VBD
its PRP$
compelling VBG
aura NN
of IN
truth NN
, ,
it PRP
was VBD
like IN
another DT

He PRP
had VBD
no DT

The DT

I PRP
